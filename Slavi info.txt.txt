My name is Slavi and I am 14 years old
I was born in Pleven but i live in Sofia since i was & years old
My hobbies are watching and playing football. Note: I am a big FC Barcelona fan.
I chose SoftUni because i started playing games a long time ago (Counter-Strike,FIFA) and then i decided that one day i will make a video game.
